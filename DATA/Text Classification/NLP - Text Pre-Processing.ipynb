    "# Step 2: Loading and Exploring the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Before using a dataset for text classification, it is important to evaluate its structure, quality, and relevance. A well-prepared dataset should contain labeled text data with minimal noise and a balanced target variable. In this step, we will load the dataset and examine its key characteristics to determine if it is suitable for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This function will:\n",
    "- Check if the dataset file exists and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- Handle potential file loading errors, such as encoding issues.\n",
    "- Display dataset shape, first few rows, and basic information.\n",
    "- Validate the presence of the required columns (text and target labels).\n",
    "- Identify missing values, duplicate entries, and unique values per column.\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of the target variable to assess balance and class proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, you should be able to determine whether the dataset is ready for text classification or if adjustments are needed before preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Checks and Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Does the Dataset Contain Enough Data?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Ensure that there are enough labeled text samples for meaningful classification.  \n",
    "**Action:** Check the number of rows and columns using `df.shape`.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Does the dataset contain enough examples for training and evaluation?\n",
    "- If the dataset is very small, will the model be able to learn meaningful patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Are the Text and Labels Properly Structured?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Confirm that the text and target labels are in the correct format.  \n",
    "**Action:** Preview the first few rows to check for formatting issues.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Is the text column readable, or does it contain unwanted symbols, encoding errors, or missing values?\n",
    "- Are the labels clearly defined, or do they need cleaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Are the Data Types Correct?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Ensure that the text is stored as strings and that the target variable is categorical or numerical.  \n",
    "**Action:** Use `df.info()` to check data types and memory usage.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Is the text column stored as a string (`object` type in Pandas)?\n",
    "- Is the target column categorical or numerical, or does it need conversion?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Are the Required Columns Present?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Verify that the dataset includes both the text and target columns.  \n",
    "**Action:** Check whether the dataset contains the specified text and target columns.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Is there a column that contains the actual text data?\n",
    "- Is there a well-defined target column for classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Does the Dataset Contain Missing Values?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Determine if missing text or labels could impact model performance.  \n",
    "**Action:** Identify missing values and decide whether to remove or fill them.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Are there missing values in the text or target columns?\n",
    "- If a large percentage of data is missing, is it still usable for classification?\n",
    "- Should missing values be removed or replaced?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Are There Duplicate Entries?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Ensure that duplicate text samples do not bias the model.  \n",
    "**Action:** Count duplicate rows and determine if they should be removed.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Are there identical reviews that might skew the results?\n",
    "- Should duplicate entries be removed, or are they meaningful (e.g., identical reviews with different ratings)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Is the Target Variable Balanced?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Check if the dataset has a reasonable distribution of class labels.  \n",
    "**Action:** Calculate the proportion of each class in the target variable.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Are some classes significantly underrepresented?\n",
    "- If one class appears much more frequently than others, will the model be biased?\n",
    "- Should techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting be considered?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Is the Text Data Meaningful for Classification?\n",
    "**Purpose:** Evaluate whether the dataset contains useful text for classification.  \n",
    "**Action:** Scan through text samples to check for gibberish, repetitive content, or irrelevant text.  \n",
    "**Questions to ask:**  \n",
    "- Does the text contain useful information that differentiates between classes?\n",
    "- Is the text too short or too repetitive to provide meaningful learning signals?\n",
    "- Does the dataset require further cleaning before classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Evaluation: Is This a Good Dataset for Text Classification?\n",
    "After completing this step, you should be able to determine whether the dataset is suitable for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset is ready if:\n",
    "- It has enough labeled text data.\n",
    "- The text and target columns are clearly structured and correctly formatted.\n",
    "- Missing values and duplicates are minimal or can be handled appropriately.\n",
    "- The target variable is reasonably balanced.\n",
    "- The text is meaningful and provides enough context for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset may need adjustments if:\n",
    "- There are too few samples to train a reliable model.\n",
    "- The text column contains a lot of missing values, gibberish, or inconsistent formatting.\n",
    "- The target labels are unclear, imbalanced, or missing.\n",
    "- There are too many duplicate entries, reducing the dataset’s diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions and reviewing the dataset’s structure, you can make informed decisions about whether the dataset is ready for classification or requires further preprocessing before moving forward.\n"

    "# Step 3: Text Standardization and Cleaning  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview  \n",
    "Now that we have loaded and explored the dataset, the next step is to standardize and clean the text. The goal is to remove inconsistencies and irrelevant elements that could interfere with text classification. At the end of this step, you should evaluate whether the dataset is clean enough for classification or if further preprocessing is needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This function will:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert text to lowercase for uniformity.  \n",
    "- Expand contractions (e.g., `\"can't\"` → `\"cannot\"`) to standardize phrasing.  \n",
    "- Remove URLs, HTML tags, and numbers that may not contribute meaningfully.  \n",
    "- Normalize whitespace to avoid formatting inconsistencies.  \n",
    "- Track and report the number of removed elements to assess the cleaning impact.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Checks and Actions  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Evaluating Text Standardization  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Ensures that text is consistently formatted, making it easier for machine learning models to process.  \n",
    "**Action:** Convert all text to lowercase and expand contractions.  \n",
    "**Ask yourself:** Does the cleaned text retain its original meaning? Are contractions expanded correctly?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identifying and Removing Noise (URLs, HTML, Numbers, and Emojis)  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Removes elements that do not contribute to text meaning or classification.  \n",
    "**Action:** Count and remove URLs, HTML tags, standalone numbers, and emojis.  \n",
    "**Ask yourself:** Was a large portion of the text made up of URLs, HTML tags, numbers, or emojis? If so, is the remaining content still meaningful?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ensuring Text Completeness  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Verifies that cleaning does not remove too much useful information.  \n",
    "**Action:** Track the number of reviews significantly altered by cleaning.  \n",
    "**Ask yourself:** Are most reviews still informative after cleaning? If too much data was removed, should some elements (like numbers) be retained?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Checking Dataset Readability  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Determines if the text still makes sense and is useful for classification.  \n",
    "**Action:** Print samples of the cleaned text to manually verify quality.  \n",
    "**Ask yourself:** Does the cleaned text still convey useful information for classification? If not, what adjustments are needed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Deciding Next Steps  \n",
    "At this stage, you should evaluate whether the dataset is suitable for classification or if further preprocessing is required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the cleaned text retains its meaning and structure, the dataset is ready for tokenization and feature extraction.  \n",
    "- If too much data was removed, reconsider whether numbers or certain special characters should be kept.  \n",
    "- If reviews contain a lot of noise, additional preprocessing (such as removing special characters or stopwords) may be necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this step, you should have a clearer understanding of your dataset’s quality and whether it is well-prepared for text classification.  \n"

The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!\n",

I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish 👍👍👍\n",

      "It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat 🌾 without any hint of maida!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Salad (4.5/5)\n",
      "Fresh cucumber 🥒, carrot 🥕 and onion with a pinch of lemon 🍋 is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali 👍👍\n",

    "## **Step 4: Tokenization of Cleaned Text**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**  \n",
    "After standardizing and cleaning the text, the next step is to tokenize it. Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units (sentences and words) that can be further processed for text classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, you should evaluate whether the tokenized text maintains its structure and meaning and whether any additional preprocessing is needed before moving forward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This function will:  \n",
    "- Split cleaned text into sentences.  \n",
    "- Tokenize each sentence into individual words.  \n",
    "- Store the results for further preprocessing or feature extraction.  \n",
    "- Compute the total token count per review.  \n",
    "- Display the top five longest tokenized reviews to verify correctness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Checks and Actions**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Splitting Text into Sentences**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Separates text into smaller meaningful units to preserve sentence structure.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Use `sent_tokenize()` to break text into sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Do the sentences make sense, or are they being split incorrectly?  \n",
    "- Does sentence splitting help maintain context for classification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Tokenizing Sentences into Words**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Converts text into individual words, making it easier for models to analyze patterns.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Use `RegexpTokenizer` to split sentences into words while preserving punctuation when needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Are words tokenized correctly, or are meaningful words being broken apart?  \n",
    "- Should punctuation be preserved or removed for classification purposes?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Handling Edge Cases**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Ensures that tokenization does not introduce errors due to empty or malformed text.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Check if any text results in empty tokens and handle them appropriately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Are there reviews that result in empty token lists?  \n",
    "- If so, should they be removed or replaced?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Computing and Reviewing Token Counts**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps confirm whether tokenization is working as expected before moving forward.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Compute the total number of tokens per review and display the five longest tokenized reviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Do the tokenized sentences and words still preserve the meaning of the original text?  \n",
    "- Should stopwords or punctuation be removed in the next preprocessing step?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Deciding Next Steps**  \n",
    "At this stage, you should evaluate whether the tokenized text is suitable for feature extraction or if additional preprocessing is required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If **the tokenization results maintain structure and meaning**, the dataset is ready for vectorization and model training.  \n",
    "- If **the tokenized words include too much noise**, consider removing stopwords or applying stemming/lemmatization.  \n",
    "- If **sentence splitting is not useful for the classification task**, consider using only word tokenization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this step, you should have a structured, tokenized dataset that is ready for further processing in a text classification pipeline.  \n"

      " review : recently we have received an invitation from hyper local. it is on the 3rd or top floor of sln terminus, gachibowli, just next to platinum cinemas. the place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. and if you go there before sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. the ambiance is pretty good, with: full bar nightlife live music private dining area available wi-fi live sports screening indoor seating smoking area buffet if you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. i find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes. they are serving ipl live screening with bucket bonanza where you can get pints of beer including a veg/non-veg starter. but you need to remember the entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed. anyway, yesterday, i went to keep the invitation. it was around : pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after pm anyday. i asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. first, they served lsd, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with types of liqueur, like gin, vodka, tequila, rum & triple sec. and made with freshly squeezed orange juice. triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. and with the use of fresh orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. i was eagerly waiting for the mocktail. thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. the mocktail was served along with chicken taco. the mocktail was made with fresh kiwi & mint. the flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice. after that i tried their chicken taco. those tacos were made for indians, so you cannot get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. those tacos were stuffed with indian spiced grilled chicken and topped with mint raita and served in malabar ghee fried parotas. taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the malabar parota. as the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, i suggested to use plain wheat four/maida tortillas, i believe the taste will also go better with the indian spiced grilled chicken. and yes, the tacos were too filling, i could have only of them. now it is time for the cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. and believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice orange flavored & very refreshing. i could only finish the /4th of the entire portion. the stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. i left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish chicken sambousek, what is that? that is baharat spiced chicken keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. served with types of dip, mayo, mint raita & sweet tamarind & saffron chutney. i liked to try these sambousek with sweet tamarind chutney, it went so well together. now you might be wondering what baharat spice is? as per the chef, the word baharat actually means \"spices\" in arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. in this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. so, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. though the sombousek looks pretty similar with samosa, but the taste was very different. and that is why the different types of dips were served. i felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. definetly overall . out of . already written about the ambiance : out of location is also easy to reach : . out of service was a professional & efficient : out of as per my experience, young people have a great option for a bar cum restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.\n",

      " - taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the malabar parota.\n",
      " - as the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing.\n",
      " - so, i suggested to use plain wheat four/maida tortillas, i believe the taste will also go better with the indian spiced grilled chicken.\n",
      " - and yes, the tacos were too filling, i could have only of them.\n",
      " - now it is time for the cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it.\n",
      " - and believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice orange flavored & very refreshing.\n",
      " - i could only finish the /4th of the entire portion.\n",
      " - the stuff were insisting me to try something else on food.\n",
      " - i left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish chicken sambousek, what is that?\n",
      " - that is baharat spiced chicken keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried.\n",
      " - served with types of dip, mayo, mint raita & sweet tamarind & saffron chutney.\n",
      " - i liked to try these sambousek with sweet tamarind chutney, it went so well together.\n",
      " - now you might be wondering what baharat spice is?\n",
      " - as per the chef, the word baharat actually means \"spices\" in arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices.\n",
      " - in this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon.\n",
      " - so, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices.\n",
      " - though the sombousek looks pretty similar with samosa, but the taste was very different.\n",
      " - and that is why the different types of dips were served.\n",
      " - i felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price.\n",
      " - definetly overall .\n",
      " - out of .\n",
      " - already written about the ambiance : out of location is also easy to reach : .\n",
      " - out of service was a professional & efficient : out of as per my experience, young people have a great option for a bar cum restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.\n",

    "## **Step 5: Punctuation and Stopword Removal**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**  \n",
    "After tokenizing the text, the next step is to remove punctuation and stopwords. While punctuation is often unnecessary for text classification, certain marks (such as `!` and `?`) may carry meaning depending on the task. Similarly, stopwords (e.g., \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is\") are commonly removed as they do not contribute significant value for classification. However, in some cases, retaining stopwords might be beneficial.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, evaluate whether punctuation and stopword removal improves the dataset’s quality for classification or if adjustments are needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This function will:  \n",
    "- Remove punctuation from tokenized words.  \n",
    "- Optionally retain punctuation that may carry meaning (e.g., `!`, `?`).  \n",
    "- Remove common stopwords (e.g., \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is\").  \n",
    "- Store the cleaned tokens for further preprocessing.  \n",
    "- Display sample text before and after cleaning to verify correctness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Checks and Actions**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Removing Punctuation**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Eliminates symbols that do not contribute meaningfully to classification.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Remove all punctuation, except for selected marks like `!` and `?` if they are considered important.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider:**  \n",
    "- Does punctuation removal improve the readability and consistency of the dataset?  \n",
    "- Should punctuation like `!` and `?` be retained because they indicate sentiment or emphasis?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Removing Stopwords**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Reduces common words that do not add distinguishing value for classification.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Remove words like \"the,\" \"is,\" and \"and\" using a predefined stopword list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider:**  \n",
    "- Does stopword removal improve classification by reducing unnecessary tokens?  \n",
    "- If removing stopwords eliminates too much information, should some stopwords be retained?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Handling Edge Cases**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Ensures that punctuation and stopword removal does not strip too much meaningful content.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Check for cases where removing punctuation and stopwords leaves text too short or empty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider:**  \n",
    "- Does the remaining text after removal still contain enough information for classification?  \n",
    "- Are some samples reduced to too few words, making them less useful?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Reviewing Cleaning Output**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps confirm whether punctuation and stopword removal preserves important text structure.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Print sample text before and after cleaning to compare the impact.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider:**  \n",
    "- Do the cleaned tokens still contain enough meaningful words for classification?  \n",
    "- Should stopword removal be adjusted to retain more useful words?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Deciding Next Steps**  \n",
    "At this stage, evaluate whether the cleaned text is suitable for feature extraction or if further refinements are needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If **the cleaned text maintains its meaning and structure**, the dataset is ready for vectorization and model training.  \n",
    "- If **removing punctuation or stopwords significantly reduces useful information**, reconsider which stopwords and punctuation should be retained.  \n",
    "- If **some text samples become too short or meaningless**, evaluate whether removing stopwords is beneficial for the specific classification task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this step, determine whether punctuation and stopword removal has improved the dataset’s quality for text classification or if further refinements are needed.\n"

      "Original: review : recently we have received an invitation from hyper local. it is on the 3rd or top floor of sln terminus, gachibowli, just next to platinum cinemas. the place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. and if you go there before sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. the ambiance is pretty good, with: full bar nightlife live music private dining area available wi-fi live sports screening indoor seating smoking area buffet if you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. i find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes. they are serving ipl live screening with bucket bonanza where you can get pints of beer including a veg/non-veg starter. but you need to remember the entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed. anyway, yesterday, i went to keep the invitation. it was around : pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after pm anyday. i asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. first, they served lsd, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with types of liqueur, like gin, vodka, tequila, rum & triple sec. and made with freshly squeezed orange juice. triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. and with the use of fresh orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. i was eagerly waiting for the mocktail. thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. the mocktail was served along with chicken taco. the mocktail was made with fresh kiwi & mint. the flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice. after that i tried their chicken taco. those tacos were made for indians, so you cannot get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. those tacos were stuffed with indian spiced grilled chicken and topped with mint raita and served in malabar ghee fried parotas. taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the malabar parota. as the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, i suggested to use plain wheat four/maida tortillas, i believe the taste will also go better with the indian spiced grilled chicken. and yes, the tacos were too filling, i could have only of them. now it is time for the cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. and believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice orange flavored & very refreshing. i could only finish the /4th of the entire portion. the stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. i left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish chicken sambousek, what is that? that is baharat spiced chicken keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. served with types of dip, mayo, mint raita & sweet tamarind & saffron chutney. i liked to try these sambousek with sweet tamarind chutney, it went so well together. now you might be wondering what baharat spice is? as per the chef, the word baharat actually means \"spices\" in arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. in this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. so, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. though the sombousek looks pretty similar with samosa, but the taste was very different. and that is why the different types of dips were served. i felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. definetly overall . out of . already written about the ambiance : out of location is also easy to reach : . out of service was a professional & efficient : out of as per my experience, young people have a great option for a bar cum restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.\n",

      "Original: *writing this review as soon as i got out of the restaurant* from the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. left right after starters. i wouldn not even care to rate it one star. one of worst restaurants to dine-in. i think it will be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more the after reaching at pm there was no receptionist. after the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than minutes to find and set up the table for just people. it was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. that is it. a piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. neither proper ac chambers nor proper cooling. it was hot. thanks pot pourri for understanding and making our dining uncomfortable. after we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we are opting for veg or non-veg. by this time i was already wondering if they thought we are idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, i just realised that it was true. after soup and buttermilk starters were served painfully slow. it took more than an hour for them to finish serving just starters. were they kidding me?? they wasted my precious time and this isn not what a customer wants. if you cannot give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. we had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(i guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer \"sorry. i will just get that served for you\". we don not want no sorry. you cannot placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. after seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to \"sorrys\". i decided to leave the restaurant. after all this he had the audacity to charge us the complete bill. it was . it wasn not even worth it even if we had the whole menu. after arguing he decided to give % discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we had. wouldn not suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant. starters: i found the starters to be normal good in quality. not very impressive nor was menu standing out. if you pay - more you will be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food. . soup: we were served chicken soup. it wasn not impressive. it was fine. . buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty. . chicken tikka: it was ok. it was hard, sometimes soft. . ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste. . kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. i mean it felt like typical indian curry. it was just good. . fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. couldn not make out if it is actually chilly. . corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. probably this is the only best thing there. . crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good. main course: i found it to be typically common. nothing new if you have been to buffets before. accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti. desserts: not much varieties. what is there is menu is served. ambience: i don not care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn not tested.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Overview**  \n",
    "After punctuation and stopwords have been removed, the next step is to normalize words using **lemmatization**. This process helps reduce words to their dictionary base forms, ensuring consistency in text classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, you should evaluate whether lemmatization improves the dataset or alters too much useful information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This function will:  \n",
    "- Apply **lemmatization** to reduce words to their dictionary form (e.g., \"better\" → \"good\").  \n",
    "- Store the transformed version of the text.  \n",
    "- Calculate how many words changed after lemmatization.  \n",
    "- Display sample text before and after transformation for evaluation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Checks and Actions**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Applying Lemmatization**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Converts words to their dictionary root form while preserving meaning.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Apply **WordNet Lemmatizer** to transform words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Does lemmatization help preserve the intended meaning?  \n",
    "- Are some words incorrectly transformed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Tracking Changes**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Measures the impact of lemmatization on the dataset.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Count the number of words that changed after lemmatization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Are a significant number of words changing?  \n",
    "- Is lemmatization making meaningful improvements?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Reviewing Sample Outputs**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps confirm whether lemmatization improves text quality for classification.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Print sample words before and after transformation to compare changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Does lemmatization retain the meaning of words while improving consistency?  \n",
    "- Should adjustments be made before moving to feature extraction?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Deciding Next Steps**  \n",
    "At this stage, you should evaluate whether lemmatization improves the dataset for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If **the transformed words maintain their meaning**, proceed to feature extraction.  \n",
    "- If **too many words are unrecognizable**, consider whether lemmatization is necessary for the task.  \n",
    "- If **words with different meanings are reduced to the same form**, review whether normalization is beneficial for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this step, you should have a standardized dataset where words are consistently formatted for text classification.  \n"

    "## **Step 7: Outlier Detection Based on Text Length**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**  \n",
    "Outlier detection based on text length helps identify reviews that are significantly shorter or longer than typical entries. Extremely short texts may lack useful information, while very long texts could introduce noise or imbalance in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, you should evaluate whether outliers should be removed, modified, or handled separately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This function will:  \n",
    "- Calculate the **number of tokens per review** to measure text length.  \n",
    "- Define **dynamic thresholds** using the **5th and 95th percentiles** to detect unusually short or long texts.  \n",
    "- Mark entries as **outliers** if their token count falls outside these thresholds.  \n",
    "- Display summary statistics for token distribution.  \n",
    "- Generate a **histogram** to visualize token count variation and highlight outliers.  \n",
    "- Show **examples of short and long outliers** for manual review.  \n",
    "- **Remove the outliers** from the dataset and return a cleaned version.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Checks and Actions**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Measuring Text Length**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Determines the number of tokens per review.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Count tokens in each entry to assess length variation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Does the dataset contain many extremely short or long reviews?  \n",
    "- Should text length be normalized before classification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Defining Outlier Thresholds**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Identifies text entries that are significantly different from the majority.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Use the **5th percentile (lower bound)** and **95th percentile (upper bound)** as thresholds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Are the threshold values reasonable, or should they be adjusted?  \n",
    "- Does the dataset require stricter or more lenient outlier detection?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Marking, Counting, and Reviewing Outliers**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Flags text entries that fall outside the defined thresholds.  \n",
    "- **Action:**  \n",
    "  - Label reviews as **outliers** if their token count is below or above the thresholds.  \n",
    "  - Display the **total number of outliers detected**.  \n",
    "  - Show **examples of short and long outliers** to help decide if they should be removed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- How many reviews are flagged as outliers?  \n",
    "- Do the flagged reviews contain valuable content?  \n",
    "- Should outliers be removed, kept, or processed differently?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Visualizing Token Count Distribution**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps assess whether token length variation is normal or extreme.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Plot a histogram showing text length distribution with threshold markers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Does the dataset contain an expected range of text lengths?  \n",
    "- Should text length outliers be handled before classification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Removing Outliers and Finalizing the Dataset**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Cleans the dataset by removing extreme-length reviews.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Remove reviews that fall outside the threshold and return a cleaned DataFrame.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- How much data is removed after outlier filtering?  \n",
    "- Does removing these reviews improve dataset quality?  \n",
    "- Is the dataset still balanced after filtering?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Deciding Next Steps**  \n",
    "At this stage, you should determine whether handling text length outliers is necessary for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If **outliers distort the dataset**, consider removing or adjusting them.  \n",
    "- If **extremely short reviews lack meaningful information**, they may be excluded.  \n",
    "- If **very long reviews dominate the dataset**, consider truncation or normalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this step, you should have a clear understanding of how text length outliers affect your dataset and whether they need to be addressed before moving forward with text classification.  \n"

      "Text: my review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over months. and now i can safely say that it is one of the good places around. they are located near the biodiversity signal, above fabindia. there is ample parking for both two and four wheelers. the ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a pdr section. the menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans continental, chinese and indian cuisines. here is the list of things that i have tried, across all my visits panko crumbed mozzarella sticks - cheese sticks that are coated and fried. pure cheese bliss. veg lasagna - this place has one of the good lasagne in the town. crispy chilli corn kernels - the usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here. makhmali paneer tikka - cottage cheese shashlik sizzler italian nachos - nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish. cheese and cheese pizza - soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives. i cannot stress enough on how i have loved all that i tried here. i have also tried out their lunch buffet. the variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. but what i really adore here is their mocktails. beyond delight is an absolute delight! also a fan of the guava and chilli, and apple and kiwi night drinks. the staff is ever so courteous. a special mention to papiya and shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. the place has zomato gold +, which further brings down their reasonable rates. a meal for two would roughly be around , that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!\n",

      "Text: we went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in zomato. the spread in buffet is too less, just veg and non veg starters, main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken biryani. desserts are ice cream and jamun. the taste was ok and not to expect too much. little disappointing when starters are not hot. fish fry was decent, schezwan chicken was ok. veg spring rolls were too good. big surprise for me is onion rings as starters kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour. chicken was ok. biryani is average, egg fried rice was good. for the money we pay, we expect some good food. they use much of colour in food item is. suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters. overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.\n",

      "Text: i would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. if you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. so basically none of the food we ordered had salt. we ordered fries, panko mozzarella sticks, tomato cream soup, panner65 & \"italian\" nachos. not sure how that was nachos or italian. they basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. the beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. the paneer was horrendous. might as well called it garlic with no salt. next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. the only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. all these came up to and odd. thanks to zomato gold, our price went down. this place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. and talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. they really need to clean up more.\n",

    "## **Step 8: Word Cloud Visualization**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**  \n",
    "A **word cloud** is a visual representation of the most frequent words in a dataset. Larger words appear more frequently, providing insight into key terms within the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, you should evaluate whether the most frequent words align with expectations for text classification or if additional preprocessing is needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This function will:  \n",
    "- **Extract words** from the dataset while handling different formats (lists or strings).  \n",
    "- **Generate a word cloud** to highlight the most frequent words.  \n",
    "- **Display the word cloud** for visual analysis.  \n",
    "- **Create a horizontal bar chart** of the top 20 words for additional insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Checks and Actions**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Extracting Words for Visualization**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Collects all words from the dataset for word cloud generation.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Iterates through the dataset, ensuring only valid words are included while filtering out invalid entries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Are the extracted words relevant to the classification task?  \n",
    "- Are there unexpected or unnecessary words appearing frequently?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Creating the Word Cloud**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Generates a visualization of word frequency.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Uses `WordCloud` to create a graphical representation of common words based on their frequency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Do the most frequent words align with the dataset's key themes?  \n",
    "- Should certain words be removed before classification (e.g., frequent but unhelpful words)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Handling Missing or Invalid Data**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Ensures that word cloud generation does not fail due to missing or unexpected values.  \n",
    "- **Action:** Skips non-string entries and logs warnings for any unexpected data types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Are there warnings about missing or unexpected values?  \n",
    "- Should additional preprocessing be done to clean the tokenized data?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Reviewing the Word Cloud and Bar Chart Output**  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps visually confirm if text preprocessing is effective.  \n",
    "- **Action:**  \n",
    "  - Displays the **word cloud** to identify dominant words.  \n",
    "  - Generates a **bar chart** showing the top 20 most frequent words for additional insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself:**  \n",
    "- Do the most prominent words make sense for classification?  \n",
    "- Are there high-frequency words that should be removed to improve model performance?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Deciding Next Steps**  \n",
    "At this stage, you should determine if any further preprocessing is necessary based on the word cloud insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If **the most frequent words align with classification goals**, proceed with feature extraction.  \n",
    "- If **unimportant words dominate the visualization**, consider additional filtering or stopword removal.  \n",
    "- If **irrelevant words are present**, check preprocessing steps for potential refinements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this step, you should have a clear visual understanding of the dominant words in your dataset and whether further text cleaning is required before classification.  \n"
